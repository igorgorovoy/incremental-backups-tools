===========================
 Incremental-Backups-Tools
===========================

Storage agnostic incremental backups tools, building blocks for creating incremental backups utility.

* Use `pyrsync <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyrsync>`_ (a pure Python rsync implementation with SHA256 hash) to compute patch/diff.
* Rely on `dirtools <https://github.com/tsileo/dirtools>`_ (for .gitignore like exlusion, and helpers it provides) 

This is initially designed as a foundation for `bakthat <http://docs.bakthat.io>`_ incremental backups plugin, so, implementation of signature, encryption, storage, management of full backups and diff is up to you.

Components
==========

DirIndex
--------

``DirIndex`` represent the state of a directory, it contains:

- the list of files and subdirectories
- and for each files, the block checksums (from ``pyrsync``)

This index should be stored (with the ``to_file`` methods, and can be retrieved latter with the ``from_file`` classmethod) each time a backup (full or incremental) is performed.
Next time you perform an incremental backups, this index should be used for creating a ``DiffIndex``.

DiffIndex
---------

``DiffIndex`` stores the changes between to ``DirIndex``.

It contains:

- the list of created, updated, deleted files.
- the list of deleted subdirectories.
- a list containing the temporary file which contains the delta (provided by ``pyrsync``)
- the latest ``DirIndex`` data

DiffData
~~~~~~~~

``DiffData`` handle the archive creation, it need a previously generated ``DiffIndex``.

The archive (tar.gz) contains two directories:

- created, where the new files are stored.
- updated, contains the pyrsync deltas.

Everything is stored at root, with the hash of the path as filename.

apply_diff
----------

To apply/patch a diff for a directory, you need two things: **the archive path** (generated by ``DiffData``) and **the diff index data** (generated by ``DiffIndex``)


Installation
============

.. code-block::

    $ pip install incremental-backups-tools


Usage
=====

.. code-block:: python

    from incremental_backups_tools import DirIndex, DiffIndex, DiffData, apply_diff
    from dirtools import Dir

    dir = Dir('/home/thomas/mydir')
    DirIndex(dir).to_file('/home/thomas/mydir.index')

    # Store the index

    old_dir_index_data = DirIndex.from_file('/home/thomas/mydir.index')

    # Make some changes in the directory

    dir_index_data = DirIndex(dir).data()
    diff_index = DiffIndex(dir_index_data, old_dir_index_data).compute()
    diff_archive = DiffData(diff_index).create_archive('/home/thomas/mydir.diff.tgz')

    # Reapply these changes from the intial directory

    apply_diff('/home/thomas/mydir', diff_index, diff_archive)
